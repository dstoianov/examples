Question:
    What is the angle between the arrows of a clock at 3:15?
    What is the angle between the hour-hand and minute-hand of a clock at 3:15?

Answer:
    The total circle is 360... Divide that by 12 to get the angle of 1 hour... That will be 30...
    If the hour-hand moves by 30 in 1 hour, it will move by 7.5 in 1/4th of an hour...

At quarter past the hour, the minute-hand is exactly at 3:00 but the hour-hand has moved 1/4 of the way between 3:00 and 4:00.
Therefore 1/4 times 1/12 = 1/48 of the clock.  With the clock having 360 degrees, 360/48 = 7.5 degrees.


At 3:15 the small-hand is (1/4) the way from 3 to 4
From 3 to 4 is 360/12 = 30 degrees
(1/4)*30Degrees = 7.5 degrees.




So the answer should be 7.5...
